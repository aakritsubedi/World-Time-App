# WorldClock

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, and the web from a single codebase. The first version of Flutter was known as codename "Sky" and ran on the Android operating system.  

#### Creating a new project 
```shell
$ flutter create <project_name>
```
this will create a sample app...  
remove all the unnecessary codeblocks and initilize the blank application to get started.
